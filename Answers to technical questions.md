A. Async Act() --- await act(async () => {  // ...});
3.	How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
A. With the new <react.profiler> you can measure a host of things programmatically yourself in the DevTools on DOM render from the phase to the times and even durations and interactions. It is ideally meant for larger applications to constantly check their performance and regressions over time. The Profiler is essentially a measuring tool for renders and it identifies the parts of your app that cause sluggishness and should benefit from memoization.</react.profiler>
